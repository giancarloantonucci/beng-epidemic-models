This repository complements an academic report titled "Deterministic Analysis and Stochastic Simulation of SIS and SIR Models" that I submitted as part of my BSc in Physical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino (Polytechnic University of Turin). The report presents a straightforward analysis of SIS and SIR models. This repository includes two files: `sis.m` and `sir.m`.
